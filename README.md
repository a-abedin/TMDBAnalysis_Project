## Additional Notes

In the first part, you face a brief simple EDA to discover the dataset and its most important features, after that you see the Feature Selection and Engineering part for a classification problem. Then, you see the classification modeling and its evaluation. The next part you encounter will be the recommender system. A very simple one, and a content-based one. In the end, there is some extra analysis on the genres, directors, actors, and etc.
